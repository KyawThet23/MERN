    Welcome to the functional programming world, a world that has only 
functions, living happily without any outside world dependencies, 
without states, and without mutations , forever.
    
    What is a function in Math?
    f(x) = y.
    • A function must always take an argument.
    • A function must always return a value.
    • A function should act only on its receiving arguments 
      (i.e., X), not the outside world.
    • For a given X, there will be only one Y

    //The following line of code is working well
    //but not suitable as function obeying rule of math 
    //cause it use value from outside world.
    var percentValue = 5;
    var calculateTax = (value) => { 
      return value/100 * (100 + percentValue) 
    };

    //let fix that
    var calculateTax = (value, percentValue) => { return value/100 * (100 + percentValue) };

    // Referential transparency
    // function going to give same value for same input , so we can cache it.
    // no need to calculate it again.

    // functional programming is declarative and writing abstracted code.

    // you need to print in console the whole array
    // in Imperative programming , we tell how to do to compiler
    var array = [1,2,3];
    for(i=0;i<array.length;i++)
    console.log(array[i]);

    // in declarative programming , we tell what to do to compiler
    array.forEach((element) => console.log(element));

    //another example with built-in method
    console.log(Math.max(3,4,5,6));
